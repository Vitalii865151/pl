            <br>
            [Intro]<br>
            Oh, oh-oh<br>
            Oh<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
            I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
            I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
            I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 1]<br>
            I got the horses in the back<br>
            Horse tack is attached<br>
            Hat is matte black<br>
            Got the boots that's black to match<br>
            Ridin' on a horse, ha<br>
            You can whip your Porsche<br>
            I been in the valley<br>
            You ain't been up off that porch, now<br>
            <br>
            [Refrain]<br>
            Can't nobody tell me nothin'<br>
            You can't tell me nothin'<br>
            Can't nobody tell me nothin'<br>
            You can't tell me nothin'<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            Ridin' on a tractor<br>
            Lean all in my bladder<br>
            Cheated on my baby<br>
            You can go and ask her<br>
            My life is a movie<br>
            Bull ridin' and boobies<br>
            Cowboy hat from Gucci<br>
            Wrangler on my booty<br>
            <br>
            [Refrain]<br>

            I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 3]<br>
            Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar<br>
            Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar<br>
            Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras<br>
            Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car<br>
            Got no stress, I've been through all that<br>
            I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back<br>
            Wish I could roll on back to that old town road<br>
            I wanna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
            I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
            I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
            I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
            <br>
            <br>

            4) Song Lyrics: Calvin Harris, Clementine Douglas - Blessings<br>
            <br> 
            [Verse 1]<br>
            I'm wrapping up this letter that I wrote you<br>
            Maybe it's the only way to cut through<br>
            I won't lose myself for anybody<br>
            I'm not sorry, yeah<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            Though it hurts, I only wish you blessings<br>
            When intuition talks, you gotta listen<br>
            I won't lose myself for anybody<br>
            I'm not sorry, yeah<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 3]<br>
            'Cause you build me up to break me down<br>
            Never respect the love you found<br>
            And I had a voice inside the back of my mind<br>
            I always knew it deep down<br>
            <br>
            [Refrain]<br>
            You don't deserve me, bae, I won't lie<br>
            Got no more tears to cry<br>
            Oh-oh, no looking back this time<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
            [Verse 4]<br>
            Runnin' from the truth was getting rеckless<br>
            In your arms I never fеlt protected, oh<br>
            <br>
            [Refrain]<br>
            'Cause you don't deserve me, bae, I won't lie<br>
            Got no more tears to cry<br>
            Oh-oh, no looking back this time<br>
            <br>
            [Bridge]<br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh (Woah)<br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            No looking back this time (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
            <br>
            [Post-Chorus]<br>
            No looking back this time<br>
